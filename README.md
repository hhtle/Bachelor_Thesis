<p align="center">─────────────────────────</p>

<p align="center"> This paper examines the role of education in decision-making in the context of social learning and misspecified models. We develop a model inspired by the 2 &times 2 &times 2 model, exploring how individuals’ decisions are influenced by their educational background and their predecessors’ action. In this paper, we develop of model that focuses of such influence under imperfect information and misinformation. The paper highlights the potential for overestimation of education’s efficacy in enhancing decision-making accuracy. Through a focused analysis of the first two agents’ choices, the research reveals insights into the dynamics of social learning, the valuation of education, and delves deeper into the impact of Agent 1’s choice onto these of Agent 2.</p>
